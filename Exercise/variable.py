# Exercise
# 1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see
# 2. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables
# 3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables
# 4. Answer which of these are invalid variable names: "__nation, 1record, record1, record_one, record-one, record^one, continue"

# 1 break = 5 # invalid syntax since break is a keyword
# 2
birth_year = 2000
current_year = 2021
print(current_year - birth_year)
# 3
first_name = "Kimhan"
middle_name = ""
last_name = "Teng"
print(last_name+middle_name+first_name)
# 4 invalid: 1record, record-one, record^one, continue
