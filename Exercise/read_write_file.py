# 2. stocks.csv contains stock price, earnings per share and book value.
#    You are writing a stock market application that will process this file
#    and create a new file with financial metrics such as pe ratio and price to book ratio.
#    These are calculated as,

# pe ratio = price / earnings per share
# price to book ratio = price / book value
